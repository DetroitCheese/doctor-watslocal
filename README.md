# Doctor Watslocal – Sector 15 Market Map - Reviews are better when unsolicited ;)

This project is an interactive map of Sector 15 Market, Faridabad — built with Leaflet.js and enhanced with audio-based annotations.

## 🔊 Voice-Guided Local Mapping
Each marker represents a real shop or site in Sector 15. Hovering over the markers plays short audio clips recorded live on location — capturing the essence of each place, from cafés to coaching centers.

## 🗣️ Future Feature: Voice Reviews
We're experimenting with a voice-to-voice review system — where instead of leaving text, users can record short audio impressions. Inspired by Google Maps reviews, but designed for tighter-knit local markets and more authentic expression.

## 🧭 Tech Stack
- [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/)
- TailwindCSS (CDN)
- Audio preloading and hover/click triggers
- GeoJSON for scalable marker definitions
- Hosted via GitHub Pages

## 🚧 Work in Progress
This is a live-mapped, gradually expanding archive of Faridabad’s local markets. We're manually charting locations via Google Earth and OpenStreetMap tools.
